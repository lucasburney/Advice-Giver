so what i'm thinkin is i get a madlibs esque style app that pulls different message bits from an array and puts them in my thing randomly. I may actually want to post thi
s to my professional github so no saying tht word cunt.

it'll have something like:

Never ever run into a restaurant while several dogs make bread...

I don't know. That seems a bit dry. But the basic structure is there

(absolute command)(thing you do) into a (place) while (creature/ creatures) (present tense action).

I can make 4 array's with strings of those things. a random number generator with array.length that places a array[i] in their places. Done.
